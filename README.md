## Insights
  
### Plan Type
* At the onset of the pandemic, Enterprise subscriptions experienced a sharp surge in sales, while the Pro plan showed more gradual growth. During this period, Enterprise plans represented 70% of total sales. However, by mid-2020 (July), Pro plan sales surged, matching those of the Enterprise plans. Over the course of 2020, 53% of total sales were attributed to Enterprise, 37% to Pro, and 10% to Business plans. Starting in mid-2021, Pro sales began to rise rapidly, while Enterprise sales saw a significant decline. This shift may have been due to plan migration, with Enterprise customers switching to the Pro plans. By the end of 2022, Pro plans accounted for 80% of total sales.
* Sales of the Business plan remained relatively stable with minimal growth. However, as Pro plan sales surged, Business plan sales also saw a decline.

### Plan Period
* Yearly plan sales experienced rapid growth at the beginning of 2020, with steady and periodic increases continuing until mid-2021. Initially, yearly plans made up 90% of total sales, but this share sharply declined by July 2021. During the same period, sales from monthly plans surged significantly, likely driven by Enterprise customers transitioning to Pro monthly subscriptions. From Q3 2021 to Q4 2022, sales were evenly split between yearly and monthly plans.

### Region
* In early 2020, North America dominated the sales. However, from May 2020 to May 2021, sales from all regions contributed equally to the total. By mid-2021, sales from North America surged, accounting for 40% of total sales. While EMEA experienced steady, slow growth during this period, sales in South America and APAC saw a gradual decline.
